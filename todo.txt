Todo:

[] Login Screen
    [x] UI
    [] Form Validation
[x] Firebase Connection
[x] Firestore helper (Can't instantiate concrete models/classes like strongly typed language?)

[] Read all user workouts
[] Create workout for selected user 
[] Dashboard
    [] Look @ Dribbble for ui inspo or material documentation for examples
