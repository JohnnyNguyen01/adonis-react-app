## Adonis Athletics Web App React 

This personal project is a companion app to the mobile app "Adonis ATLAS Mobile" that's 
made using Flutter. The purpose of this companion app is for coaches to write up 
workouts for clients, who then use the mobile app to track their progress. Updates made in the web app
appear real-time within the mobile app.

This passion project is my first react app, coupled with my second Flutter app, and will be
maintained indefinitely as of writing this.
